# React-Projects

A personal workspace for building **small React projects** while learning and experimenting with **React + TypeScript (TSX)**.

This repository is focused on **learning by doing**, not on shipping production-ready applications.

---

## About

This repo contains multiple independent React projects created to:

- Learn and practice **React fundamentals**
- Get comfortable with **TypeScript in React (TSX)**
- Understand **state, props, hooks, and data flow**
- Experiment freely without worrying about perfection
- Make mistakes, refactor, and improve over time

Projects here may be incomplete, messy, or refactored multiple times — that’s intentional.

---

## Tech Stack

- React
- TypeScript (TSX)
- React Hooks
- Common tooling (Preferably rspack)

---

## Repository Structure

- Each project lives in its **own folder**
- Projects are generally **self-contained**
- There is no shared architecture across projects
- Patterns may vary from project to project based on what was being learned at the time

This repo reflects **progress**, not consistency.

---

## Notes

- Some projects may be unfinished
- Older code may not follow current best practices
- Refactors may happen as understanding improves
- Comments and experiments may be left in place intentionally
